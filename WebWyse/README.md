It is adapted to all videosystems, which allows it to be used for any program consisting of more than one file.

## Installer functionality

* Software License Agreement
* Checking computer hardware for system requirements
* Ability to install additional components for the program
* Choose a path to install files
* Nice and clear interface, guaranteed to work on all 3 videosystem tiers


## Distribution

There are **two** blanks for software here:
* `empty.lua` contains the full version of the code (if you want to modify the installer for yourself)
* `minified.lua` contains the minified code to save size (it is recommended to use it)

All parameters in the configuration zone are described,
however, if you have problems, you can use configurations from [VychVyzhProm](https://github.com/Bs0Dd/OpenCompSoft/blob/master/VychVyzhProm/installer.lua),
[TapFAT](https://github.com/Bs0Dd/OpenCompSoft/blob/master/TapFAT/installer.lua) or [Midday Commander Plus](https://github.com/Bs0Dd/OpenCompSoft/blob/master/MiddayCommanderPlus/installer.lua) as an example.
