Welcome, comrade!

In programming, to start from "nothing", you should program with punchcards or assembler at least))).

In this game, you will be playing as a soviet engineer working in a ВычВыжПром (VychVyzhProm) laboratory with a task to draw simple patterns with a programmable burner device. So you have to write a code in assembler to make it move.  
Information about assembler instructions and burner controller can be found in the game itself.

This game is a port (completely rewritten in Lua for OpenComputers) of a Java game written by the [CAT IN THE DARK](https://catinthedark.itch.io/) team for [Ludum Dare 45](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45).  
The original game source code is available [here](https://github.com/cat-in-the-dark/ludum_45_omsk).  
Due to technical limitations, the game was slightly simplified in interface, but the gameplay was carried over without changes.

Special thanks to [BOOtak](https://github.com/BOOtak) for a little help with graphics and testing.
